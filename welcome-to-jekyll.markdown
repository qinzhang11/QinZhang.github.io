I am currently an Assistant Professor with the VCC group at College of Computer Science & Software Engineering, Shenzhen University. I received my Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering from Xidian University in 2022, supervised by Prof. Xinbo Gao. Prior to that, I received my B.E. from the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian Univeristy in 2017. My research interest is computer vision, currently with emphasis on visual emotion analysis. I am also interested in image aesthetic analysis and image generation.

```javascript
const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```
